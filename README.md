# this is a song that never ends.

 https://thecollabagepatch.com/infinitepolo.mp3

this song has branches, kinda like a react tree. `three.py` is the 3rd iteration.

- `branch1`, `original.wav` is the entrypoint. the script begins there.
- there are slices that can be extended into whole branches.
- `branch2` begins and ends at specific bars in the `original.wav` in `branch1`.

the script uses the filenames to pick slices to move in and out of:

```
slice9_bar13_bar27.wav
```

this slice was used to begin `branch2`'s `original.wav`.

this Python script was used along with human ears and fingers to get individual slices out of each `original.wav`:

`branch3` might begin from a slice in `branch2`. don't see why that would be a problem.

most recently, it took kev upon last listen about 45 minutes before he finally heard most or all of `branch2`.

this is kinda like a white paper for a possible cool new way to jam that no one else will rly enjoy but him.
