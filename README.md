# this is a song that never ends.

this song has branches, kinda like a react tree. `four.py` is the 4th iteration.

- `branch1`, `original.wav` is the entrypoint. the script begins there.
- there are slices that can be extended into whole branches.
- `branch2` begins and returns to bar 13 in the `original.wav` in `branch1`.
- `branch3` begins at bar 28 and returns to bar 1 in the `original.wav` in `branch1`.

the script uses the filenames to pick slices to move in and out of:

```
slice9_bar13_bar27.wav
```

this slice was used to begin `branch2`'s `original.wav`.

this python script was used along with human ears and fingers to get individual slices out of each `original.wav`:

`branch4` might begin from a slice in `branch2`. don't see why that would be a problem.

the logic for our song will become continuous in a flask app or something. it has now gotten too complex for 60 minutes. 

TODO: does my song need a database now i think it do

this is kinda like a white paper for a possible cool new way to jam that no one else will rly enjoy but me.

@zeuzmakesmusic made the remix that this song branches out from.
